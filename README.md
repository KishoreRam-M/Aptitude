# 🎯 ULTIMATE 15-DAY APTITUDE ROADMAP
## Beginner to Master (Zero Math Knowledge)

---

## ✅ PART 1: GLOBAL PREREQUISITES
### What You MUST Learn First (Days 1-3)

**Number Basics**
- Counting, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (0-1000)
- Why: Every aptitude question uses these. Weak basics = 80% errors.

**Fractions & Decimals**
- 1/2, 0.5, 50% all mean the same thing
- Why: Ratios, averages, interest all use parts of a whole.

**Percentages**
- 25% = 25/100 = 0.25 = 1/4
- Why: Profit, loss, interest, discounts all are percentages.

**Basic Algebra**
- Solve: x + 5 = 10 → x = 5
- Why: Ages, work, mixture problems use equations.

**Tables & Squares**
- Memorize: 1-20 multiplication tables
- Memorize: Squares like 15² = 225, 12² = 144
- Why: Speed. Saves 5 minutes per test.

**Mental Math Tricks**
- Double fast addition, quick division (e.g., 120 ÷ 4 = 30)
- Why: Tests are timed. Mental math builds confidence.

### Average
- **Needs**: Addition, division, ratios
- **Why**: Mean of numbers; weighted averages use ratios

### Ages
- **Needs**: Basic algebra, ratios, averages

### Discounts
- **Needs**: Profit & Loss, percentages
- **Why**: Chained discounts (10% then 20% off)

### Simple Interest
- **Needs**: Percentages, basic multiplication
- **Why**: Interest = % per year; like profit over time

### Compound Interest
- **Needs**: Simple Interest, exponents
- **Why**: Interest on interest; A = P(1+R/100)^T

### Permutations
- **Needs**: Factorial (1×2×3...), counting
- **Why**: Arrangements; independent topic

### Probability
- **Needs**: Permutations, fractions
- **Why**: Favorable outcomes / total outcomes

### Volume & Surface Area

## 🔗 PART 3: CORRECT LEARNING ORDER
### Why This Order Works for Weak Students

```
WEEK 1 (Days 1-7):
Prerequisites → Ratio → Average & HCF/LCM → Ages → Time & Work & Pipes

WEEK 2 (Days 8-14):
Time & Distance → Trains → Height → Profit & Loss → Discounts → SI → CI

WEEK 3 (Day 15):
Permutations → Probability → Volume (Review all)
```

**Why This Works**:
- Days 1-3: Build confidence (number is easy!)
- Days 4-7: First applications (ratios to work)
- Days 8-12: Money topics (profit to interest)
- Days 13-15: Advanced counting (perms to shapes)

Each day builds on yesterday—no jumping ahead.

## 💪 PART 5: HOW TO STUDY (NOT BORING)

### Daily Routine
```
25 min study + 5 min break (Pomodoro timer)
Do this 4 times = 2 hours
Best time: Morning (brain fresh for math)
```

### The 3-Step Learning Process
1. **Watch Video** (10 min from Khan Academy / Unacademy)
2. **Copy Formula & Examples** (5 min; understand, not memorize)
3. **Solve Problems** (45 min; easy first, then moderate)

### Questions Per Day
- **Easy**: 20-30 questions (build confidence)
- **Moderate**: 15-25 questions (check understanding)
- **Hard**: 5-10 questions (optional, tackle later)

### Handling Mistakes
- **When you get it wrong**: 
  - Don't feel bad—mark it ❌
  - Redo the same question 3 times next day
  - Ask "Why wrong?" (forgot formula? units? reading error?)
- **Mistakes are teachers**—best way to learn

### Build Confidence
- **End every day with 5 wins** (easiest questions)
- **Track success**: Keep a notebook: "Today: 45/50 = 90%! 🎉"
- **Use a calendar**: X mark each day you study (don't break the chain)
- **Celebrate small wins**: Solved ratios? That's progress!

### If You Get Stuck
- **Don't give up**
- **Watch 2-min explanation video** (hint, not answer)
- **Sleep on it**, try again tomorrow
- **10-min rule**: If stuck >10 min, ask for hint (not solution)

### Weekly Review
- **Every morning (10 min)**: Redo yesterday's 10 wrong questions
- **Every Saturday (1 hour)**: Full practice test from that week

## ⚠️ PART 6: COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### Calculation Mistakes
- **Error**: 17 × 6 = 92 (wrong!)
- **Fix**: Always estimate: 17 ≈ 20 → 20 × 6 = 120, so answer near 100 ✓

### Ratio Mistakes
- **Error**: Divide by 2 instead of 5 parts in 2:3 ratio
- **Fix**: Draw lines: ||| || = 5 parts total. Then 2/5 and 3/5.

### Work & Pipes Mistakes
- **Error**: Forget to invert; A does in 4 days but use 4 not 1/4
- **Fix**: Rate = 1/time always. A = 1/4 per day.

### Speed & Distance Mistakes
- **Error**: Mix units (km/hr vs m/s)
- **Fix**: Write units every time. 60 km/hr, not just 60.

### Profit & Interest Mistakes
- **Error**: Profit% on SP instead of CP
- **Fix**: Profit% = (SP - CP) / **CP** × 100. Always CP.

### Permutation & Probability Mistakes
- **Error**: Forget "with replacement" cases
- **Fix**: List small cases first (coin toss, cards)

### All Topics
- **Error**: Skip steps, write nothing, panic
- **Fix**: Write every formula, underline answer, no shortcuts
